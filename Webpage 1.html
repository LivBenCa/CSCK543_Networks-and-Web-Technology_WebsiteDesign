                    <h2>The Original Crew</h2>
                    <p> It all started with a bunch of kids with snowboards, who wanted to make the most out of their Christmas holidays.
                        At this time fun parks for snowboarder were only available in the alps or USA. 
                    <p> So WE brought this spirit to our hometown.</p>       
                    <p> Every winter some new vibes, people and fun elements were added to this place. The time seemed endless and wonderful.
                        Unfortunately, with by time we all got out of school and into jobs. So we somehow lost each other and the park. But we didn't lose
                        the passion for snowboarding.</p>
                    <p> For this reason and the dedication to the park and the time we created this website shall remember the good old days.</p> 
                    <p> A stylish and fun world where we created a place for us and kids from all around the county where we would come together and create our lifestyle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second-left-paragraph">
                    <h2>Home Base</h2>
                    <p> We were not located in the south of Germany and the alps were more than 6 hours away. But we lived in the uplands of the "Sauerland",
                        which means land of springs in English.</p>
                    <p> Of course there are no stoney mountains with glaciers, but at least a couple of +800m hills.
                        So, snow was given to us almost all winter.</p>
                    <p> Obviously it is common sense for teenagers who love to ride, to build a snowpark in DIY style - whatelse. 
                        Some guys from our village even came around with a rope winch to speed things up a little.</p>
                    <p> The first obstacles we built were more in a practical than a stylish sense. And the more experience we got the bigger and 
                        more professional our obstacles looked.</p>
