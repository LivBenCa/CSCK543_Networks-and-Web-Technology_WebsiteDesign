                <h2>Park Layout</h2>
                <p>If you would ask us what the Whiteside Snowboard Park makes so special, we would probably all agree
                    that it is the simplicity and DIY style. Since we were only kids at that time, it was just a simple meadow with a slope
                    and some obsticles - it was our own work that we knew in every detail.</p>
                <p>The ease also came with the fact that there was nothing much between you and the fun. No tickets to buy, no lift to use,
                    and no journey upfront. The slope starts right next to the street and the parking space. You could sit on the lid handle
                    of your trunk and start straight from there.</p>
                <p>After the starting point  we mostly built rails or other stuff to slide on - the longer, the better. Often we installed 
                    two rails right behind each other, with only a few metres for jumps, gaps or spins.</p>
                <p>To keep the action up until the end, we always installed a quarter pipe at the foot of the slope and use the speed make
                    some incredible plants or jumps.</p>
                <p>In the following video you can see one of our layouts and how we used to ride them.</p>
